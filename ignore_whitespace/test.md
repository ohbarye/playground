# Ignore Whitespace

GitHub suddenly removed ignore whitespace feature as known as `w=1`.
Listen developers' voice...

  srsly @github you're killing me, please bring back ?w=1 whitespace diff trick!
  @github why doesn't ?w=1 work anymore!? 
  RIP `?w=1` cc @github
  When did “?w=1” stop working for PRs on @github? #bringitback

GitHub brought back it!?
